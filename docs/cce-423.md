### Introduciton

#### Wireless Communication

- Evolution of wireless communicaiton $\to$ self study
- Block diagram of wireless communication

!!! note "To-Do"
    Block diagram of encrypted communicaiton

### Chapter 02 : Wireless Transmission

- Compostite Signal $\to$ Fourier transform
- Isotropic Radiator (Antenna) $\to$ ideal antenna

!!! note
    Signals attenuate in space

- $4 \pi d^2$

- Simple dipole + monopole
- directed and sectorized
- diversity

**Smart Antenna**

- Switched Beam
- Adaptive Array

**Signal Propagation Range**

- Transmission
- Detection
- Interference range

**Signal Propagation**

**Multipath Propagation**

- delay spread (cause)
- Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) (reason)

#### 2.14.1 Effects of Mobility

- fading
    - short time
    - long time
- doppler effect

- Engineers calculates these:
    - (Ray Tracing)

**Multiplexing 4 dimentions:**

- space (s) $\to$ Guard Space needed
- time (t)
- frequency (f)
- code (c)

#### 2.16.1 Frequency Multiplex

- frequency bands $\to$ static
- Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI)

#### Time Multiplex

- Co-channel Interference

#### Time and Frequency

- certain frequency band for a certain time
- GSM

####  Code Multiplex

- Orthogonal Code $\to$ multiplication (of two code) = 0

#### 2.20.1 Modulation

Digital Modulation

#### Advanced Frequency Shift Keying (MSK)

- even, odd bits
- doubling each bits
- $f_1$ $\to$ lower frequency
- $f_2$ $\to$ higher frequency
